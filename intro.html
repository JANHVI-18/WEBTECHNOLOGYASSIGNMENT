            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Janhvi Jaiswal, a second-year student pursuing my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree at UPES, Dehradun. I have a passion for technology and its endless possibilities. Since starting my journey here, I've loved diving into the world of engineering and discovering new things every day.

            I've always been fascinated by how things work, especially in the realm of computers and technology. From learning the basics of coding to exploring advanced concepts, I've been eager to soak up as much knowledge as I can. Being in my second year now, I feel like I'm starting to grasp the complexities of the field, and it's incredibly rewarding.

            Apart from academics, I like to stay involved in campus life. Whether it's joining clubs, volunteering for events, or just hanging out with friends, I believe in making the most of my college experience. It's not just about studying; it's also about growing as a person and making memories that will last a lifetime.

            I'm excited about what the future holds and eager to continue learning and growing. With every challenge I face, I know I'm one step closer to achieving my goals and making a difference in the world.</p>
